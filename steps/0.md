# Step 0: Set-up.

## Python Anywhere

...what is Python Anywhere?

## Get a Python Anywhere account.

Visit https://www.pythonanywhere.com/, click 'Pricing and signup' and the 'create a Beginner account'.
Enter your details and click 'register'.

Go to your email and click the link in the email you've been sent.

## Set up our project.

Now you're logged in, click on the 'Web' tab in Python Anywhere, then 'Add a new web app'.
Click 'next'
Click 'Manual configuration'
Click 'Python 3.5'
Click 'next'

You will now see the 'Configuration' page for your new web app. Scroll down to the 'Code' section, and click on the link next to 'WSGI configuration file:'.

WHat you'll see now is a text editor and some code.  Delete all of this code, and paste in the following (you will need to replace 'your username' with your Python Anywhere username):

```
# This file contains the WSGI configuration required to serve up your
# web application at http://<your-username>.pythonanywhere.com/
# It works by setting the variable 'application' to a WSGI handler of some
# description.
#
# The below has been auto-generated for your Flask project

import sys

# add your project directory to the sys.path
project_home = u'/home/your username/springer-nature/build-a-website'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path

# import flask app but need to call it "application" for WSGI to work
from server import app as application
```

Now you're ready to begin!
