### Requirements:

* Python 3

* A text editor

* A terminal

* A browser

* An internet connection


### Installation tips:

#### Mac

Python 3

* Check to see if Python 3 is already installed: try both `python --version` and `python3 --version`. If it is - you can skip this step.
* Install homebrew: Follow the instructions at https://brew.sh/
* Install python3: `brew install python`
* Check it's working: `python --version`

Text editor

Any text editor is fine, but an editor with code highlighting will be beneficial. A decent choice would be Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/

Terminal

You have one! It's an application on your system called, helpfully, `Terminal`

#### Linux

You're on your own, but it's likely you already have Python 3 and a decent text editor!
