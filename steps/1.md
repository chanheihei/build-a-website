# Build a website using Python, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

# Step 1: Hello World (...Wide Web)
A website is a program that receives requests and sends responses over the Internet.  But that's a lot easier said than done.  Fortunately, it's also so utterly fundamental that the heavy lifting is already done for us by something else; something we call a **web framework**.  Most programming languages have a number of web frameworks to choose from and Python is no exception.  We are going to use a framework called [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

## Installing Flask
Seeing as we know we will need Flask - let's install it:
Open a terminal window.

```
pip install Flask
```

## Creating the server
Open terminal.
Make a folder (or 'directory') for your work during workspace. we use a command called 'mkdir' for this, and we give it the name 'springer-nature':

```
mkdir springer-nature
```
You are going to create several files in this space that will all interact to form your website. Let's make a directory within the 'springer-nature' directory especially for those files, to group them all together.
First of all we have to navigate inside the springer-nature directory. To do this we use a command 'cd', or 'change directory':

```
cd springer-nature
```

Now let's make the main directory for our website:

```
mkdir build-a-website
```

OK! Now let's make the first file.
Create a file in your workspace called `server.py`. There are several ways we can do this. To make an 'empty' file, we can use a command called 'touch', and give the file a name:

```
touch server.py
```

Open the file in your text editor and add the following content. Don't worry if you don't understand what we're doing here:

```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Make sure you save the file.  Now try running it from the command line:

```
$ python server.py
```

To stop the program running, press Ctrl+C in the command window.
