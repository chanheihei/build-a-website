# Step 1: Hello World (...Wide Web)
A website is a program that receives requests and sends responses over the Internet.  But that's a lot easier said than done.  Fortunately, it's also so utterly fundamental that the heavy lifting is already done for us by something else; something we call a **web framework**.  Most programming languages have a number of web frameworks to choose from and Python is no exception.  We are going to use a framework called [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

## Flask
We know that we will need Flask - but we don't need to install it as already available in Python Anywhere. 

## Create a directory to store your files
In your terminal window, make a folder (or 'directory') for your work for the next two weeks. We use a command called 'mkdir' for this, and we give it the name 'springer-nature':

```
$ mkdir springer-nature
```

## Creating the server
All websites need at least one server of some kind, so we will need to create one.
You are going to create several files in this space that will all interact to form your website. Let's make a directory within the 'springer-nature' directory especially for those files, to group them all together.
First of all we have to navigate inside the springer-nature directory. To do this we use a command 'cd', or 'change directory':

```
$ cd springer-nature
```

Now let's make the main directory for our website, and give it the name 'build-a-website':

```
$ mkdir build-a-website
```

and now we 'cd' into it:

```
$ cd build-a-website
```

If you want to see what files are in the directory you are currently looking at, type:

```
ls
```

OK! There are no files here. Let's make the first file.
Create a file in your workspace called `server.py`. There are several ways we can do this. To make an 'empty' file, we can use a command called 'touch', and give the file a name:

```
$ touch server.py
```

Open the file in the Python Anywhere text editor and add the following content. Don't worry if you don't understand what we're doing here. You can either type the content or copy and paste:

```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Make sure you save the file.  Now try running it from the command line:

```
$ python server.py
```

You should get a message in your terminal window that says something like this:

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You can see the result by copying the URL and pasting it into your browser. 
Nobody else can access this website - we would need to do more work to achieve that - but we're heading in the right direction.

To stop the program running, press Ctrl+C in the command window.
